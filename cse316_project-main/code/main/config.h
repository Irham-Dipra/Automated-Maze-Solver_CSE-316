// Returned when no echo comes back. MUST be a large "nothing there" value,

// robot permanently on the first missed ping.
#define SONAR_NO_ECHO          999

// Distinct from NO_ECHO: a wall is present but closer than the sensor can
// measure. These MUST NOT share a value -- a sub-minimum reading means
// "wall about to be hit", the exact opposite of "nothing there". Aliasing
// them makes the robot report an opening at the instant it is about to
// collide, and (in maze mode) turn straight into the wall.
#define SONAR_TOO_CLOSE        1

// Physical ambiguity: below ~3 cm the echo can return before the sensor
// finishes transmitting, so a very near wall often produces a timeout that
// is indistinguishable, at the ping level, from open space. Disambiguate
// with history instead: if the previous good reading was within this
// distance, a sudden loss of echo means the wall got CLOSER, not that it
// vanished. Walls do not disappear in 60 ms.

//  6. MOTION-SUSPECT DETECTION  (your point #5)

// When the chassis pitches or rolls, a perpendicular sonar beam tilts off the
// wall -- it can hit the floor (short reading) or sail over the wall top
// (NO_ECHO). We watch the gyro's X and Y axes.
//
// Units: raw LSB at +/-500 dps (65.5 LSB per deg/sec).
// History: started at 650, which sat BELOW normal gear-motor vibration and
// latched permanently while driving. Raised to 2200, still tripped ~77% of
// ticks -- measured logs show the ROLL axis (gy) peaking near 2900 LSB
// (~44 deg/sec) from ordinary chassis vibration, while pitch (gx) stays
// under ~700. 3000 clears the measured vibration floor.
//
// Note this flag no longer invalidates sonar data (see sonar.c); it only
// reduces the wall-term gain. That makes the exact value far less critical
// than it used to be -- a wrong threshold now degrades tuning, not function.
#define ROCK_RATE_THRESHOLD    3000

// How long after a rocking event to keep distrusting sonar.
#define ROCK_BLANKING_MS       120

// While rocking, the wall term is applied at REDUCED gain rather than being

// Your chassis will not start moving below this. Every commanded speed is

// Measured on the actual chassis. MOTOR_MIN_PWM is below the stall floor of
// ~60 on purpose: in a differential turn the slow wheel briefly dropping
// under its own stall point makes it act as a pivot, which tightens the
// correction. Both wheels are never commanded this low at once.
#define MOTOR_MIN_PWM          45
#define MOTOR_MAX_PWM          140

// Straight-line cruise speed. Lowered from 75: at the higher speed the robot
// covered too much ground during each correction and swerved close to the
// walls. Slower means the same angular correction translates into less
// lateral overshoot.

// straight-line code, where a positive accumulator slowed the right wheel).
//
// Raised from /120 to /65. At /120 the damping was far too weak to oppose
// the proportional term: measured logs show wt=+19 against gt=-10 at
// -17.8 deg/s, so the controller kept commanding MORE right-turn while
// already turning right hard. The result was a runaway correction turn that
// swung the front sonar off an obstacle. At /65 the two terms balance near
// 18 deg/s, so the correction self-limits instead of winding up.
#define WALL_KD_NUM            1
#define WALL_KD_DEN            65

// The correction is a DIFFERENTIAL about DRIVE_BASE_PWM, so its steering
// authority is the ratio corr/base, not its absolute value. Lowering the
// base speed without lowering this makes steering MORE violent, not less.
// At base 60 a +-35 differential is a 58% split; 37% keeps it proportionate
// to what +-35 gave at the original base of 75.
#define WALL_MAX_CORRECTION_RATIO_PCT  37

// Never let the differential exceed this, or a bad reading can spin the robot.
// Derived from DRIVE_BASE_PWM so lowering the base speed automatically
// softens the steering instead of sharpening it.
#define WALL_MAX_CORRECTION    ((DRIVE_BASE_PWM * WALL_MAX_CORRECTION_RATIO_PCT) / 100)

// Emergency avoidance: inside this distance the proportional correction is
// too slow. Severity now RAMPS with proximity rather than slamming to full
// differential at the threshold -- measured logs show a hard +-35 step at
// exactly 8cm produced 71 deg/s of yaw and bounced the robot from one wall
// straight into the other.
#define WALL_EMERGENCY_CM      8

// WALL-STUCK RECOVERY.
// The ramped emergency steer above still drives BOTH wheels forward -- it
// only varies the split. If a chassis corner physically catches the wall
// (friction pins it), that forward-biased differential cannot rotate the
// robot away: it just grinds along the wall at an angle instead of turning
// off it. Observed on hardware. If a one-sided emergency stays active this
// long without clearing, stop assuming steering alone will break contact:
// stop pushing forward, back straight off the wall, then pivot away from it
// in place before letting normal centring resume.

// YAW GOVERNOR.
// Hard ceiling on how fast the chassis may rotate while centring. Beyond
// this the sonars are pointing far enough off-axis that their readings stop
// describing the corridor -- the front beam in particular walks off whatever
// is ahead. Once exceeded, the controller stops ADDING yaw in that direction
// (it does not reverse; it just stops winding up) and lets the rotation
// decay. Units: raw LSB; 65.5 LSB per deg/sec. 1300 ~= 20 deg/sec.

// Front is considered blocked closer than this. Must be generous enough that
// at a T-junction the front wall registers as blocked BEFORE the two side
// openings appear -- otherwise a T momentarily looks like the maze exit.
// (Currently equals OPENING_THRESHOLD_CM by coincidence, not by design --
// they are independent constants for different sensors and may diverge if
// either is retuned.)

// Higher than OPENING_CONFIRM: a spurious U-turn is expensive.
#define DEADEND_CONFIRM        3

// Front-obstacle detection uses VOTING over a window, not consecutive hits.
//
// Why: the front sonar is rigidly mounted, so whenever the chassis yaws to
// correct its position the beam swings off-axis. A real obstacle straight
// ahead can then be missed for several consecutive pings -- measured logs
// show F reading 51,60,57,65,65 (INCREASING) while driving into an obstacle
// at ~50cm, because a sustained ~18 deg/s correction turn walked the beam
// off the target. A "2 consecutive" rule can never fire in that situation.
//
// Voting fixes it: an obstacle that shows up in ANY 2 of the last 5 pings is
// treated as real. Obstacles do not vanish; intermittent detection during a
// yaw is expected, so intermittent evidence must be enough.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  11. END-OF-MAZE DETECTION  (your point #3)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// All three sensors open => exit. But at a left-or-right T-junction both side
// openings can appear a moment before the front wall closes in, which looks
// identical for a short window. So: on first detection, drive on this far and
